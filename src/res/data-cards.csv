,meta,desc,,"Ice Flows a bit like a river with tributaries and main channels, only quite a bit slower! This stat tells you how fast each ice stream is flowing at its fastest point.","The ice in Antarctica can be thousands of metres thick, this stat tells you the maximum ice thickness for each ice stream","The ice in Antarctica can be thousands of metres thick, this stat tells you the average ice thickness for each ice stream","The fastest flowing parts of the ice stream are most responsive to changes in climate, this stat tells you the thickest ice in this region","A lot of the ice in Antarctica rests on a bed which is below sea level, this stat tells you the lowest bed elevation for each ice stream","A lot of the ice in Antarctica rests on a bed which is below sea level, this stat tells you the average bed elevation for each ice stream","The fastest flowing parts of the ice stream are most responsive to changes in ocean temperature, this stat tells you the lowest bed elevation in this region","The grounding line is where the ice starts to float - the lower the bed elevation here, the more it is likely to respond to changes in ocean temperature","Ice Streams have catchment areas much like rivers, this stat tells you how big the catchment area is","A lot of the ice in Antarctica rests on a bed which is below sea level, the higher this percentage, the more vulnerable the ice stream is to climate change",This stat tells you the volume of ice contained in each ice stream catchment,"If all the ice were melted and the meltwater put in the ocean, this is how much global sea level would rise by as a result."
